Email Checker
=============

This is a simple script to check for emails using IMAP. It will "click" on 
links or "view" web bugs contained in HTML emails by requesting the resource 
in the default browser. It will also attempt to open attachments using the 
default application for the attachment's MIME type. It is used to simulate a 
user receiving and opening emails for client-side attacks in sandboxed 
training network environments.
